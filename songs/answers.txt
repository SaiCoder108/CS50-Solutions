If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
The audio aura can be characterized by the average energy, danceability, and valence values. High energy suggests upbeat, fast-paced tracks, while low energy reflects more relaxed music. High danceability implies rhythmic music, and high valence indicates happiness. This defines the listener's musical mood as either vibrant or mellow.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Averaging might not represent the listener accurately due to outliers, context (e.g., seasonal preferences), and genre diversity. Songs played during specific moods or times might skew results. A better approach could group songs by genre, use clustering algorithms, or weight songs based on play frequency for accuracy.
